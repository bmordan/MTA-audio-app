We are going to build a frontend application that will use or touch upon all the knowledge required to pass the Microsoft Technical Associate Exam (MTA 70-480 Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3). It is a peer to peer audio composition app where you can create tracks, play them back, share them with the network of other composers, and play their compositions in your player.
